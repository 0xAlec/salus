# Salus Documentation 
## Overview
The salus website is dependent on two different branches. salus-docs and salus-website. 

### [`salus-docs`](https://github.com/coinbase/salus/tree/salus-docs)
This branch contains the markdown files that are converted to html files with [retype](https://retype.com). 

### [`salus-website`](https://github.com/coinbase/salus/tree/salus-website)
This branch contains the html files generated by retype. This is the branch that is hosted on github pages. 

## Contributing
The salus-docs branch is the primary branch for contributing to the salus documentation / website.

### STEP 1) 
Since this branch is unrelated to the master branch, you have to create a branch from it.
```sh
git checkout salus-docs # checkout salus-docs branch
git checkout -b <your-branch-name> # create a branch off of salus-docs
```

### STEP 2) 
The next step is to install the dependencies for the project. You will need to get retype inorder to run the website locally

```sh
npm install retypeapp --global  
retype watch # This builds the website and hosts it at http://localhost:5000/salus/
```
Any changes made will trigger retype to rebuild the website. 


### STEP 3) 
- Once all your updates are made, you can commit your changes and push to your branch.

- This will trigger the github-action - `Build Retype Website without errors` - This github-action ensures the changes made do not introduce any errors.

- Once its merged in, The next github action is triggered(`Generate web files for salus-website branch`). This will generate the html files for the project and create a PR with your changes to the  [`salus-website`](https://github.com/coinbase/salus/tree/salus-website) branch


### STEP 4)
- Review the PR created by github-actions and ensure your changes were updated on the site
- Once your code is merged in, check the [website](https://coinbase.github.io/salus) to ensure your changes have been updated
