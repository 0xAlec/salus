# [Gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec)

The [Gosec Scanner](https://github.com/securego/gosec) is a static analysis tool that finds vulnerabilities in Go projects. It inspects source code for security problems by scanning the Go AST. Gosec supports Go modules as of Gosec 2.0.0.


## Configuration

We plan on supporting setting options via a global config file; however, this has not been implemented yet.
