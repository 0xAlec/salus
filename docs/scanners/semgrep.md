# [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev)

[`semgrep`](https://semgrep.dev) (syntactic grep) is an open-source tool for finding patterns in code. It's useful for preventing the use of known anti-patterns in a codebase or enforcing the correct use of secure-by-default frameworks (e.g. always use a project's sanitization method on user-provided data).

semgrep is fast and powerful; it's grep-esque patterns are lifted into AST matchers. Compared to regexes these patterns arenâ€™t affected by whitespaces, comments, newlines, the order of keyword arguments, variable renaming, and other language nuances.

Currently, the supported languages are: C, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

## Configuration

There are two types of rules in Semgrep:

1) [Simple rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#simple-rules) - expressed with a single `pattern`.
2) [Advanced rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#advanced-rules) - expressed with multiple patterns, like: X must be true AND Y must be too, or X but NOT Y, or X must occur inside a block of code that Y matches.  These patterns are composed with the `patterns` keyword.

In salus.yaml, both simple and advanced rules can be specified with a path to a [Semgrep YAML config file](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/docs/configuration-files.md).
In adddition, simple rules can be specified directly in salus.yaml.

#### Speciying path to Semgrep YAML config

In salus.yaml, you can specify a semgrep rule with a path to a [Semgrep config file](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/docs/configuration-files.md).  You **must** specify

* `config` - a full Semgrep config file
* Either `required: true` or `forbidden: true`
** If a found pattern is forbidden, this scanner will fail and the `message` will be show to the developer in the report. A `required` pattern must be found in order for the scan to pass.

In addition, you can **optionally** specify

* `exclude_directory` - directory to exclude from scanning
** The glob pattern will match anywhere in the file path parts so for example `exclude_drectory: [node_modules]` will ignore both `./node_modules`, `lib/node_modules`, and `demo/demo2/node_modules`. Passing in full paths such as `exclude_drectory: [lib/node_modules]` is not supported.

Here is an example semgrep section of a salus.yaml.  Each match represents a rule.

```yaml
scanner_configs:
  Semgrep:
    matches:
      - config: semgrep_config_1.yaml
        required: true
      - config: semgrep_config_2.yaml
        forbidden: true
        exclude_directory:
          - tests
```

Example semgrep config file
```yaml
# semgrep_config_1.yaml
rules:
  - id: eqeq-always-true                  # Unique, descriptive identifier (required)
    patterns:                             # patterns or pattern or pattern-regex (required)
      - pattern: $X == $X
      - pattern-not: 0 == 0
    message: "$X == $X is always true"    # Message if rule (forbidden and found) (optional)
                                                         or (required and not found)
    languages: [python]                   # Any of: c, go, java, javascript, or python (required)
    severity: ERROR                       # One of: WARNING, ERROR (required)
```

#### Adding simple rule directly (without Semgrep config file)

Simple rules that can be expressed with a single `pattern` can be directly specified in salus.yaml.
Each simple rule **must** include

* `pattern` - the single pattern
* `forbidden: true` or `required: true
* `language`- Any of: c, go, java, javascript, or python

The user can **optionally** provide
* `exclude_directory` - directory to exclude from scanning
** The glob pattern will match anywhere in the file path parts so for example `exclude_drectory: [node_modules]` will ignore both `./node_modules`, `lib/node_modules`, and `demo/demo2/node_modules`. Passing in full paths such as `exclude_drectory: [lib/node_modules]` is not supported.
* `message` - Message if rule (forbidden and found) or (required and not found)

Example,

```yaml
scanner_configs:
  Semgrep:
    matches:
      - pattern: $X == $X
        message: Useless equlity check
        language: python
        forbidden: true
        exclude_directory:
          - tests
      - pattern: $X.unsanitize(...)
        message: Don't call `unsanitize()` methods without careful review
        language: js
        forbidden: true
        exclude_directory:
          - node_modules
      - pattern: $LOG_ENDPOINT = os.getenv("LOGGER_ENDPOINT", ...)
        message: All files need to get the dynamic logger. Please don't hardcode this.
        language: python
        required: true
      - config: semgrep_config.yml
        required: true
```

## Limitations of Semgrep

* There may be parser-related issues from Semgrep
** Parser-realted issues are will be displayed as warnings and will not cause salus to fail.
** Salus will still show semgrep results on files that do not have parser issues.
* Salus semgrep currently does not support scanning against [pre-built rules.](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#run-pre-built-rules)
** But we plan to support this in the near future!
