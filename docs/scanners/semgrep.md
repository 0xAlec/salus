# [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev)

[`semgrep`](https://semgrep.dev) (syntactic grep) is an open-source tool for finding patterns in code. It's useful for preventing the use of known anti-patterns in a codebase or enforcing the correct use of secure-by-default frameworks (e.g. always use a project's sanitization method on user-provided data).

semgrep is fast and powerful; it's grep-esque patterns are lifted into AST matchers. Compared to regexes these patterns arenâ€™t affected by whitespaces, comments, newlines, the order of keyword arguments, variable renaming, and other language nuances.

If a found pattern is forbidden this scanner will fail and the `message` will be show to the developer in the report. A `required` pattern must be found in order for the scan to pass.

The scanner also allows options `exclude_extension` and `include_extension` for excluding and including file extensions, respectively. These options can be set globally and per-match. While these options can be combined they are AND'ed together by the filtering engine. There is also a `exclude_directory` option for excluding directories.

## Configuration

```yaml
scanner_configs:
  Semgrep:
    matches:
      - pattern: $X == $X
        message: Useless equlity check
        language: python
        exclude_directory:
          - node_modules
        include_extension:
          - "*.js"
          - "*.py"
      - pattern: $X.unsanitize(...)
        message: Don't call `unsanitize()` methods without careful review
        language: js
        forbidden: true
        exclude_extension:
          - "*.rb"
          - "*.js"
```
